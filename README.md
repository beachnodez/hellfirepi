# HellfirePiAim of HellfirePi is to provide intelligent fully featured controller for my house's heating system. Though the way I'm trying to develop this project should make it easy adaptable to other heating systems configurations as well.My heating system components:- wood fueled water boiler- 800L buffer tank- radiator system with mixing valve## FeaturesHellfirePi tasks:- control fuel burning process by manipulating air intake shutter? using on exhaust pipe thermocouple and water temperature readings- control heat buffering process- control radiator circuit through enabling and disabling it's water pump as well as through operating mixing valve- gather statistics and data for more efficient fuel burning techniques- provide safety related features like:  - provide failover solutions: water boiling prevention, etc.  - warnings and alerts sent over text messages as well as through dedicated iOS application (long term plan). ## HardwareHeart of this controller makes Raspberry Pi with several external DB18b20 temperature sensors along with MAX6675 chip connected to thermocouple K on boiler's exhaust pipe that allows measuring temperatures up to 800 degrees Celsius.Devices controlled (or to be controlled) by this software:- heating circuit water pump- heating circuit mixing valve- boiler circuit water pump- boiler air intake controlled with servo## RaspberryPi connections map```+----+-----+-------------------+---------------------------------------------+|wPi | Phs | Pin name          | Used as                                     |+----+-----+-------------------+---------------------------------------------+|    |   1 | 3.3v              | powering 3.3v line                          ||    |   2 | 5v                | not used                                    ||  8 |   3 | SDA.1             | not used                                    ||    |   4 | 5v                | not used                                    ||  9 |   5 | SCL.1             | not used                                    ||    |   6 | 0v                | not used                                    ||  7 |   7 | 1-wire data line  | 1-wire devices (thermal sensors)            || 15 |   8 | TxD               | not used                                    ||    |   9 | 0v                | providing GND for 3.3v line                 || 16 |  10 | RxD               | not used                                    ||  0 |  11 | GPIO. 0           | wired to buzzer (makes noise on LOW)        ||  1 |  12 | GPIO. 1           | not used                                    ||  2 |  13 | GPIO. 2           | not used                                    ||    |  14 | 0v                | not used                                    ||  3 |  15 | GPIO. 3           | servo control line                          ||  4 |  16 | GPIO. 4           | not used                                    ||    |  17 | 3.3v              | not used                                    ||  5 |  18 | GPIO. 5           | not used                                    || 12 |  19 | MOSI              | SPI (thermocouple & analog sensors)         ||    |  20 | 0v                | not used                                    || 13 |  21 | MISO              | SPI (thermocouple & analog sensors)         ||  6 |  22 | GPIO. 6           | not used                                    || 14 |  23 | SCLK              | SPI (thermocouple & analog sensors)         || 10 |  24 | CE0               | SPI CS for analog sensors                   ||    |  25 | 0v                | not used                                    || 11 |  26 | CE1               | SPI CS for thermocouple                     || 30 |  27 | SDA.0             | not used                                    || 31 |  28 | SCL.0             | not used                                    || 21 |  29 | GPIO.21           | relay 8                                     || 21 |  30 | 0v                | not used                                    || 22 |  31 | GPIO.22           | relay 7                                     || 26 |  32 | GPIO.26           | not used                                    || 23 |  33 | GPIO.23           | relay 6                                     ||    |  34 | 0v                | not used                                    || 24 |  35 | GPIO.24           | relay 5                                     || 27 |  36 | GPIO.27           | relay 1                                     || 25 |  37 | GPIO.25           | relay 4                                     || 28 |  38 | GPIO.28           | relay 2                                     ||    |  39 | 0v                | not used                                    || 29 |  40 | GPIO.29           | relay 3                                     |+----+-----+-------------------+---------------------------------------------+```## Software VendorsSPI sensors communication for HellfirePi is realized by https://github.com/frak/php_spi1-wire sensors readings are provided through W1Server I developed myself and will probably extract it later as a standalone component in a separate repository.Servo control is realized by servoblaster from For my setup it's supposed to be launched this way:./servod --p1pins=15 --min=500us --max=2440us
